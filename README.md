Completed python (week 5) homework for Monash University Data Analytics Boot Camp.

## The Power of Plots
* Top level summary, tables, and figures for the mice study on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth under different drug regimens (*Data is entirely fictional*).
* Folder structure include -
	* **Data** folder - contains 2 csv files used for summary -
		 * **Mouse_metadata.csv**
		 * **Study_results.csv**
	* **pymaceuticals.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing code and summary
* Tables and figures included in **pymaceuticals.ipynb** are - 
   1. Table of summary statistics of tumor volume (mm3) across drug regimens
   2. Bar chart of mice count across drug regimen
   3. Pie chart of gender distribution of mice in study
   4. Box and whisker plot of tumor volume (mm3) distribution in mice across 4 drug regimens
   5. Line plot of tumor volume (mm3) of an example mouse (s185) across testing days
   6. Scatter plot of mouse weight (g) and tumor volume (mm3) for the Capomulin treatment regime
   7. Scatter plot and linear regression line of mouse weight (g) and tumor volume (mm3) for the Capomulin treatment regime
